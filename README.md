RESTAPI 

Demontrating the RESTAPI using WebApp.
To build the REST API's I have used eclipse IDE with springboot framework and maven along with mongodb(database).
The three REST API's are personREST,productREST,employeeREST.The three REST API's can perform basic CRUD operation.
I have created a database named restapi on mongodb which has 3 different collections for 3 APIs respectively.
For each collection I have inserted 5 entries. 
 
Steps:
 1.Start mongodb using command prompt
 2.Run the first API as java application on eclipse IDE.
 3.Show demo using POSTMAN:
     A>Create a new entry(POST)
     B>Retrieve all the entries(GET)
     C>Update one entry(PUT)
     D>Delete one entry(DELETE)
 4.Repeat Step 2 and Step 3 for the remaining two APIs.
